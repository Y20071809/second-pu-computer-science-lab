a. Create a table for a class of students.

create table student (
  sid number(4),
  sname varchar2(25),
  s1marks number(3),
  s2marks number(3),
  s3marks number(3),
  s4marks number(3),
  s5marks number(3),
  s6marks number(3) );

b. Insert records into the table.

Insert into student values (11, 'Rahul', 90, 88, 75,56,99, 66);

Insert into student values (14, 'Ankita', 80,78,87,97,85,74);

Insert into student values (15, 'Kiran', 70,28,96,59,74,54);

Insert into student values (13, 'Manu', 97,92,34,77,65,84);

Insert into student values (12, 'Asha', 60,78,87,97,74,77);

c. Display the description of the fields in the table.

desc student;

d. Add and calculate total percentage of marks.

alter table student add (total number(3), percentage number(2) );

update student set total = s1marks + s2marks + s3marks + s4marks + s5marks + s6marks;

update student set percentage = total / 6;

e. Compute the result as "pass" or "fail" by checking if the student has scored more than 35 marks in each subject.

alter table student add result varchar2(4);

update student set result = 'pass' where s1marks > 35 and s2marks > 35 and s3marks > 35 and s4marks > 35 and s5marks > 35 and s6marks > 35;

update student set result = 'fail' where s1marks < 35 or s2marks < 35 or s3marks < 35 or s4marks < 35 or s5marks < 35 or s6marks < 35;

f. List the contents of the table.

select * from student;

g. Retrieve only student id and name of all students.

select sid, sname from student;

h. List the students who have result as pass.

select * from student where result='pass';

i. List the students who have result as fail.

select * from student where result='fail';

j. Count the number of students who have passed.

select count(*) from student where result='pass';

k. Count the number of students who have failed.

select count(*) from student where result='fail';

l. List the students who have percentage greater than 60.

select * from student where percentage > 60;

m. Sort the table order according to the order of student id.

select * from student order by sid;
